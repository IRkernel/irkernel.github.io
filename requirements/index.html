<p>To run Jupyter with an R kernel, you need at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=http://jupyter.org>Jupyter</a>. If you already have a Python environment set up, install Jupyter using your preferred tools. If not, installing <a href=http://continuum.io/downloads>Anaconda</a> is the quickest way to get everything you need.</li>
<li>A current <a href=http://www.r-project.org>R installation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Installing from source needs additionally header files (see next step).</p>
