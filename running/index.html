<p>If you have Jupyter installed, you can create a notebook and switch to IRkernel from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>You can also start other intefaces with an R kernel:</p>
<pre class="bash mdl-shadow--2dp"><code># “ir” is the kernel name installed by the above 'IRkernel::installspec()'
jupyter qtconsole --kernel=ir
jupyter console --kernel=ir</code></pre>
<h3>IPython</h3>
<p>What is now Jupyter was once a part of the IPython project. If your operating system doesn’t yet have Jupyter, but instead IPython version 3 packages (IPython 1 and 2 are not supported), you can substitute <code>ipython</code> for <code>jupyter</code> in above commands and it will work.</p>
